# Harvard-Forest-Pheno-Shift

This is our final project for Biostats. We will be analyzing the shift in when leaves change colors in trees at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts.

The repo includes relevant data files (hf003-08-fall-mean-spp.csv), an R Markdown file of the project proposal (TreeColorFinalProj-Proposal.Rmd), and an R Markdown file of the actual final project (FallColorShift.Rmd). 

This work was done by Kevin Buck, Kyle Elliot, and Sidney Higgins, student in the College of Science at the University of Notre Dame.
